        # IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
        # Do NOT inject the Gemini API key here – building a client-side bundle with the key will expose it publicly.
        # Preferred pattern: prompt user for API key at runtime and keep it in localStorage / memory.
        # If you MUST set at build time, create an environment 'GEMINI_API_KEY' and map to REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY,
        # understanding it will be visible in the browser dev tools.
